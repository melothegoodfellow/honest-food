1. I was delayed by approx. 30 mins because my BSNL BB dropped and I had to use JIO 4g as a backup and it is slow.
2. I used https://mygeodata.cloud/converter/kml-to-json website to convert the KML file to GeoJSON .json file is in the assets folder of node-geo-location.
3. NodeJS backend.
- npm install.
- Please use "npm run dev" to run the backend project.
4. VanillaJS frontend.
